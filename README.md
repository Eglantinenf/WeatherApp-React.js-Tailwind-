## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eglantinenf/TodoList-React.js-Tailwind.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TodoList-React.js-Tailwind ```
3.Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
```
3.Start the development server:

```bash
   npm start
 ```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will reload when you make changes. Any lint errors will also show up in the console.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, refer to the [React testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. However, itâ€™s not recommended unless you need custom configuration.
